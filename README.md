# Soft 65C02

Soft65C02 is a suite of softwares dedicated to 65C02 machine code testing and debugging. It is composed of 3 parts:

 * soft65C02_lib: a Rust library to simulate a 65C02 processor you can use in your own developments.
 * soft65C02_tester: a CLI tool to run automated tests against 65C02 machine code.
 * soft65C02_studio: (yet to develop) a CLI tool to run, debug machine code and create tests scripts.

If you want to use the old CLI tool, the last working version is e7e6615.

This is a pet project so if you are interested into real world software
regarding this processor, I suggest you have a look

## Tester
The tester is the heart of this project. It aims at testing applications from the processor perspective. 
It features:
 * raw, apple, atari binary file support
 * asserter on values in registers or memory
 * programmable execution unit runs the processor unil a condition is met or step by step execution
 * tested 65C02 implementation
 * test plans support

### Example

Here is an example of test script: it loads a binary file (Apple Prodos format)
and perform some dumb tests to show the tester syntax:

```
marker $$loading apple single binaries$$
memory load apple "tests/apple.bin"

// setup initial state of registers, force SP to 00 so we can verify it changed
registers flush
registers set SP=0x00

// testing registers and memory
assert X=0x00           $$X is flushed before running$$
assert #0x0803=0xa2     $$first byte of code is LDX (0x42)$$

// validate the code sets X register and transfers to SP
run #0x0803 until X!=0x00
assert X=0xff           $$register X was set in first instruction to $FF$$
assert CP=0x0805        $$only 1 instruction was performed$$
assert SP=0x00          $$stack pointer is still $00$$

run until SP!=0x00
assert CP=0x0806        $$only TXS was performed$$
assert SP=0xff          $$x is moved into sp$$
```

Here is the output of a test run:

```
$> cargo run -- -v -i tests/test_apple.txt
ðŸ“„ loading apple single binaries

## FAQ

### Why would you write another simulator for the 65C02?

I started this project in 2020 to learn the [Rust
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and â€¦ the 65C02. It has been a real
pleasure to code in the Rust programming language, guys & girls, you have
created awesome tools.

### The Rust language OK, but why the 6502 and not a modern processor?

Because the 6502 comes from an age where processors were built by humans for
humans. So the 6502 is a very good way to learn how processors work and are
programmed. Plus, the 65C02 is cool.

It's all [Ben
Eater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU)'s fault by the way.

### What's the actual state of this development?

The library is supposed to be wire to wire compatible with a real 65C02. The
first version of this software (2020 â†’ 2024) was a CLI against the library but
if this was a good first step it was not testable enough for evolving. In 2024 I
took advantage of free time to split the project in a Rust workspace to dig more
in GUI part. I rewrote the Tester with parser tests this time. The Studio is
yet to write.

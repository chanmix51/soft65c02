disassemble $start 0x3A

// the atari min crt0 sets up the FFFC/D RESET vector to the correct start address, which itself calls _main
// so we can isolate the setup code with the following:
run init until CP = $_main


assert A = 0        $$A is clear$$
assert X = 0        $$X is clear$$
assert Y = 0        $$Y is clear$$

// we don't have a way to check the status flags yet without testing whole status value, which is awkward
// assert C = 0        $$C is clear$$

// clear the cycle_count, so we can get a true count of the tested function
registers set cycle_count = 0
run $_main while (CP >= $_main AND CP <= 0x2100) AND cycle_count < 50

// this is a failing test, as our cycle_count condition is hit before X gets to 0
assert X = 0         $$X ends up being 0$$
